# 2D Basketball Game

# Overview
Welcome to the 2D Basketball Game! This game is a fun and challenging basketball simulation developed in Java, leveraging the JBox2D physics engine. 
The objective is to score points by successfully making basketball shots through five progressively difficult levels.

This was my first ever game project, built on a 2d Game engine, provided to me by City, University of London

# Game Features
-Realistic Physics: The JBox2D library ensures realistic physics for ball movement and collisions.
-Five Levels: Progress through five levels of increasing difficulty, each with its own unique challenges.
-Scoring System: Score points by making successful basketball shots to advance to the next level.
-Interactive Environment: Explore an interactive game environment with dynamic obstacles.
